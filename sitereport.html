           <!-- short introduction facing during this assignment --> 
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
               <p>As this was my first assignment I had to face many difficulties because its was my very first experiences of using html and css. Even though it was very hard for me at the beginning phase of my study but due to help of my module Mr. Ankit Thapa I could successfully do my assignment with the guidance provided . I was completely unknown  about the uses of coding, debugging process, design but my module Mr. Ankit Thapa helped me during my assignment by conducting online classes. The use of github like  checking status, cloning, adding the files, committing, pushing, etc in github with help of gitbash and error occured during this process was solved with the help of my module. While doing my assignment many problems were seen in coding with the help of online research in sites, YouTube, Geogle, etc was huge help during my assignment. Placeholder image was downloaded, menu bar in each of the web page is same in overall the web pages and it is linked with each other. During assignment period I learned many things from the errors and problems occured in github like to initiate the file before checking the status and pushing the file in github, closing the tags in html, uses of appropriate design tags in css, etc. To make pages responsive in different tabs, mobiles, PC, etc use of media query was done from notes provided from  my module. The explanation, errors, validations, references, etc of the different web pages have been mentioned below.</p>
